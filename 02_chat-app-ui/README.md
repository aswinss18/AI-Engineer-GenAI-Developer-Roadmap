This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## FAISS Search Mode

This UI also includes a **FAISS Search** option on the home screen.  When you select it you can enter a query and the frontend will
proxy the request to a vector‑search backend running separately (default `http://localhost:8001`).

The backend URL can be overridden with the `SEARCH_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in
`.env.local` or your deployment environment.  Make sure the FAISS server (found under
`03_mini_search_engine_FAISS`) is running (e.g. `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001`) before
clicking the Search mode.

The results returned from the backend are displayed as a numbered list inside the chat
window so you can quickly inspect the raw payload without having to switch tools.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
